This post references a Stack Overflow discussion regarding parameter passing between Electron's main and renderer processes.

The question addresses a common challenge in Electron applications: how to safely and efficiently pass data from the main process to renderer processes.

## The Problem

In Electron, the main process and renderer processes run in separate contexts for security reasons. This separation means you can't directly share variables between them.

## Solution Approaches

Common approaches to solve this include:

1. **IPC (Inter-Process Communication)** - Using `ipcMain` and `ipcRenderer` modules
2. **Remote module** - Though deprecated in newer Electron versions
3. **Preload scripts** - Exposing specific APIs to the renderer via contextBridge
4. **URL parameters** - Passing data through the window's URL when creating BrowserWindow
